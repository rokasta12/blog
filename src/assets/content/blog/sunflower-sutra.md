### **Single layer Rosenblatts Perceptron -Python**

Single layered Rosenblatts Perceptron

Rosenblatt's approach to neural networks was really important and also contributed this area so much , lets look implementation of this algorithm with Python.

First this perceptron can only classify two classes that can be linearly seperable.If your data is not linearly seperable you have to use a non-linear transform to seperate linearly.(Generally we transfer our data to  higher dimensions)

Things to do

> -Seperate Training and Test data and Shuffle Them
>
> \-Train  data
>
> \-Generate data
>
> \-And visualize test data and decision surface

to be continued...
