# Creating custom URL shortener with Nodejs Vue MongoDB

This small project has an Express api that user can send url that wants to make it more small and looking nice.And also if someone makes a get request to this shortened url server routes user to original url.

This project is hosted on github and it wasn't necesarry to deploy client and server seperately and also used Vue from cdn.
